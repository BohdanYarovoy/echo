Check methods for putting(changing) entities, cause when you change object, you need validate this.
I give you create classes for updating such entities and describe validation rules there.
It is a good way to use these classes in controllers to accept changes for entities.

Clean up code. You need to pay attention to validation, that is implemented by DB exception.
